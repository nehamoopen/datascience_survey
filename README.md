# LIBER DSLib Survey

The LIBER Data Science in Libraries (DSLib) working group explores and promotes library engagement in applying data science and analytical methods in libraries, taking into account all kinds of processes and workflows around library collections and metadata as well as digital infrastructures and service areas.

The DSLib WG working on a landscape analysis of data science in libraries and would like to invite representatives of libraries to take part in this initiative and contribute information.  

The survey results will be used to analyze the current landscape of data science in libraries. A pseudonymized summary of the results will be presented in a DSLib landscape analysis and events featuring the working group.

In the survey, we ask for respondents' names, e-mail addresses, job titles, and library affiliations. Providing your name and e-mail address is optional, in case you're open to being contacted for additional questions and/or discussion. The job titles and library affiliations will be made publicly available in conjunction with specific (data science) activities.

Feel free to consult with your colleagues while completing the survey. After starting the survey, a draft of your responses will be kept for 7 days and you can return to the draft and submit your final responses later.

If you have colleagues working with data science within your/another LIBER-affiliated library, please invite them to complete this survey.       
In case of questions or feedback, you can contact Peter Verhaar (P.A.F.Verhaar@library.leidenuniv.nl) or Peter Kiraly (peter.kiraly@gwdg.de).
